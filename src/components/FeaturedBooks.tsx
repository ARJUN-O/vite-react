            F2 Factor is a compelling feel-good romance that takes readers on a
            rollercoaster ride of emotions, love, and self-discovery.
            Twenty-one-year-old Freya Majid dreams of freedom and an exciting
            life as she prepares to pursue higher education in London, far away
            from her authoritarian and traditional parents. But fate has other
            plans. A two-wheeler accident derails her carefully crafted
            ambitions, leading to a series of unexpected events. Pressured into
            an arranged marriage, Freyaâ€™s world spirals out of control when the
            man from the accident reappears at her fiancÃ© meeting, only to
            create chaos that ends with her losing consciousness. When Freya
            wakes up, sheâ€™s shocked to discover that two and a half years have
            passed, her memories have been wiped clean, and the man she once
            considered her nemesis is now her husband. Confused and struggling
            to adapt to this unfamiliar life, Freya feels like a stranger in her
            own story. While she fights to reclaim her independence and escape
            the life she doesnâ€™t recognize, her husband is determined to
            rekindle the love that once united them. Will Freya rediscover the
            passion and connection she has lost? Or will her forgotten love
            story slip away forever? F2 Factor is a tale of resilience, second
            chances, and the power of love to transcend even the greatest
            challenges.
